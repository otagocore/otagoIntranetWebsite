    "text": "4.3 Adding Data to ORCA Sample Management Database\n\n4.3.1 Inital Steps\nYou will need to check that some of the fundamental data for the samples you are entering int the database has already been entered e.g. principal scientist, coring platform, program etc. If this data is not in the in the database it will need to be enteed prior to entering the sample information.\nFor example, the if the Principals link in Figure 4.2 is selected, a list of all the Principal Investigators (PI) already in the system will open (See Figure 4.2 (a)). If the PI for the samples being entered is not on this list, they will need to be entered. Select the Add button in the top right corner of the screen (See Figure 4.2 (a)) and a data entry screen to enter the new PI will open (See Figure 4.2 (b)). Fill out the required information and select on Save to enter the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The main window showing the PI’s in the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The window that appears after Add is selected in the main PI window.
