The view upon entering the admin screen can be seen in @fig-orcaIntroScreen


## Adding Data to ORCA Sample Management Database

### Inital Steps


You will need to check that some of the fundamental data for the samples you are entering int the database has already been entered e.g. principal scientist, coring platform, program etc. If this data is not in the in the database it will need to be enteed prior to entering the sample information. 

For example, the if the *Principals* link in @fig-orcaDbPrincipalMain is selected, a list of all the Principal Investigators (PI) already in the system will open (See @fig-orcaDbPrincipalMain-1). If the PI for the samples being entered is not on this list, they will need to be entered. Select the *Add* button in the top right corner of the screen (See @fig-orcaDbPrincipalMain-1) and a data entry screen to enter the new PI will open (See @fig-orcaDbPrincipalMain-2). Fill out the required information and select on *Save* to enter the data.

### Enter data for samples that follow the ORCA naming convention


#### Data required for all samples
All sample sites will have data entered the Expedition, Site and Drop tables

##### Expedition Table


##### Site Table

To enter data into the Site table select *Sites* from the **Site Administration** window and Select *Add Site*

Standard sites will require the following information to be entered

1. An expedition to be selected from the drop-down, 
2. a 3 Letter Location Code e.g DUS shall be entered into the Location Code field 
3. 3 digit Site Number e.g 001 shall be entered into the Identifier field 

The fields that must be filled are indicated in red in @fig-orcaDbSite-1.

Click save at the bottom of the page to save the data into the Site table. 

For a site where the sample being collected is a long core, that is, the sampling tool is entering the same hole multiple times and collecting numerous core sections to increase the sampling depth e.g. IODP core collected off the Joides Resolution, the Ohau core collected using a Hydraulic Piston Corer, the UoO Uwitec corer etc.

The additional fields that must be filled out in the event a long core is collected are 

4. Latitude (dd.dddddd)
5. Longitude (ddd.ddddd)
6. Water depth (m)

These fields are indicated in blue in @fig-orcaDbSite-2.

#| - "The site data required for long cores "

```

##### Drop Table

To enter data into the Drop table select *Sites* from the **Site Administration** window and Select *Add Drop*


Standard drops will require the following information to be entered

1. A site to be selected from the drop-down
2. Select the device being used at the site from the drop-down e.g. PST
3. The date of the drop, if the drop date is unknow enter 1900-01-01
4. The time of the drop, if drop time is unknown enter 00:00:00
5. The sample number,this is a 2 digit number.
6. Latitude (dd.dddddd)
7. Longitude (ddd.ddddd)
8. Water depth (m)

The fields that must be filled are indicated in red in @fig-orcaDbDrop-1.


In the event a long core is collected at the site, the latitude,longitude and water depth should not be entered into this table, as it will already have been entered into the site table

The required fields for the drop table are


1. A site to be selected from the drop-down
2. Select the device being used at the site from the drop-down e.g. PST
3. The date of the drop, if the drop date is unknow enter 1900-01-01
4. The time of the drop, if drop time is unknown enter 00:00:00
5. The sample number,this is a 2 digit number.

Ther additional field required t be filled out when collecting a long is 

6. Enter a Hole Id for the site. A for the first hole at a site B for the second hole at the site etc. If the rig moves to a new site start at A again
